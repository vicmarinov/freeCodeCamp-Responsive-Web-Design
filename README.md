Responsive Web Design
=====================

This repository contains the projects I created while completing the [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design) course on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

Each project was built primarily using HTML and CSS, exploring different aspects of structure, layout, and responsive design, while some small JS scripts were added to enhance the interactivity and improve the user experience on mobile devices.
